Hard Min Flex Ratio: 501 / 1000
Soft Min Flex Ratio: 1000 - MAX(flexed)

Unflex Phases
    Grow without exceeding the max unflexed total, drawing towards soft minimums

This assumes a default unflexed ratio of 1/2, which is the lowest possible value

1: 100,120
2: 100,120
3: 100,120
4: 100,xxx 501,520
5: 100,120 -> 300,300

Feeding chain
Unflexing 5
    First draw from the unflexed surplus, this nets 60 points

1: 100,100
2: 100,100
3: 100,100
4: 100,xxx 501,520
5: 180,180 -> 300,300

    Then start drawing from the other unflexed minimums, respecting the current flexed value
    until the highest 3 of 1,2,3,4 is less than or equal to (1000-520)-300 = 180
    So we take 40 off of each

1: 60,60
2: 60,60
3: 60,60
4: 60,xxx 501,520
5: 300,300 -> 300,300

    Now we've reached the target. Let's say we want to go further though
    and we actually want this to be a very large unflexed value of 490
    It looks like if we continue, our other unflexed values will hit 0,
    which is something we don't want.
    So we will need to introduce a new value called an unflexed *hard* minimum
    Lets say it's 30. Now that we're pushing past soft minimums and towards hard minimums

1: 30,30
2: 30,30
3: 30,30
4: 30,xxx 501,520
5: 390,390 -> 490,490

    We've now exhausted our unflexed pool.
    The hard minimum is global and cannot be compromised on
    And we still have 100 left.
    Looks like this number will be impossible to reach, but we still have some to draw from the flexed space
    Previously we were

Default flex ratio : Golden
Max flex ratio: 900 / 1000
Soft Min flex ratio: Default
Hard Min flex ratio: 501 / 1000
Hard min unflexed: 50 / 1000 # extremely small, not usable just out of the way
Soft min unflexed: 100 / 1000 # the smallest usable value
